## problems I'm trying to solve
* [FIXED] helm templates started throwing errors again
    another problem occurs, and I'm afraid it can break something in future:
    `Client 1 quit with exit code 2 and signal 0` after editing a file with `ft=helm`
    although, the ugly errors stopped popping after I created an `autocmd`.
* terraform auto formatting doesn't work on save (only works with a remap)
